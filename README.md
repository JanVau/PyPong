# PyPong
Multiplayer Pong using Python and PyGame 
created by Jan Vaudo

It is played with just the keyboard. Player 1 (left side) uses the W and S keys to move up or down, while Player 2 (right side) uses the Arrow-Up and Arrow-Down keys respectively.

This is my personal experimental Python, pygame and Pong project.
